/**
 * The emoji picker popover - the editor behind a `table` input's `emoji` column
 * (schema `columnEditors`).
 *
 * The grid itself is `unicode-emoji-picker` (MIT, Julien Marcou): a web component
 * that reads the Unicode Emoji data files, so it knows every emoji in the 17.0
 * release rather than whatever list we would have frozen into the repo. This
 * module is the thin part around it - the popover box, where it opens, when it
 * closes, and what a pick does.
 *
 * ## Everything here is lazy
 *
 * Nothing in this file, its stylesheet, the component, or the 1.9 MB Noto Color
 * Emoji face is fetched until someone taps an emoji cell. That is why the import
 * of the component below is dynamic and why the stylesheet is imported HERE
 * rather than added to the app sheet: this module is only ever reached through a
 * dynamic import, so the bundler gives it, its CSS and the component their own
 * chunk. Do not import this module at the top level of anything on the boot path.
 *
 * ## Why the popover is on <body>
 *
 * A table cell can sit in the sidebar (which clips its overflow and carries a
 * backdrop filter), or inside a popped-out float panel. Mounting the popover on
 * <body> and positioning it `fixed` in viewport coordinates escapes every one of
 * those, the same conclusion components/color-field.ts reached - which is also
 * where fixedContainingBlockOrigin comes from, for the rare page whose <body>
 * itself traps `fixed`.
 *
 * ## The grid draws the chosen set (plan 252)
 *
 * A caller that hands in `options.emoji` gets a grid painted from the emoji set
 * the document chose, not from whatever face the machine has: the runtime's own
 * pass walks the component's shadow root and swaps each cluster for the pack's
 * artwork. See drawPackArtwork below for what is drawn, when, and why a device
 * with no chosen set keeps the grid it already had.

 * Draw the grid from the chosen emoji set.

 * the clipped span the engine writes, and the placement is styled inline, so no
 * stylesheet has to reach inside the shadow boundary. The component keeps its own
 * data, so search, keyboard focus and what a pick reports are all untouched.
 *
 * Three decisions a reader should know about.
 *
 * The whole grid is not drawn at once. Every cell of every category is in the DOM
 * from the moment the component mounts, and one pass over all of them measured
 * 2,982 ms in jsdom on a 2026 laptop: 3,953 cells, one distinct glyph each, from
 * the full Twemoji Color pack. A second pass over the same drawn grid is 163 ms,
 * so it is the first one that has to be kept small. Only the cells the component
 * is showing are drawn (about 99 ms for the 60 of a first screen), and each burst
 * (the grid being built, a category switch, a search, cells losing `lazy-load` as
 * they scroll into view) draws whatever became visible, coalesced through one
 * frame. A drawn cell is left alone, which the engine's own idempotence makes
 * cheap anyway.
 *
 * With no set drawing, the grid is left exactly as the component made it. A probe
 * over a detached copy of the tab strip says whether any artwork comes back: a
 * device with no packs, a document with no set chosen, or a host with no emoji
 * API at all gives nothing, and a grid of several thousand identical placeholders
 * is not a picker. The canvas is where a missing choice is reported, and the
 * Emoji section is where it is made.
 *
 * A set chosen while the grid is open redraws it. The engine's pass is idempotent,
 * so a cell that is already drawn would otherwise keep the set it was drawn with
 * for as long as the surface lives. A pass that also carries `revert` gets
 * `redraw()`: the characters go back, the probe runs again, and the visible cells
 * are drawn from the new set. Only a surface that outlives a choice needs it - the
 * popover closes on the pick - so the character browser wires `onSetChange` and the
 * popover does not.
