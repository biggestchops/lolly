 * The room's `addColors` writes into the LIVE document the editor is holding
 * - the only correct target. This view once kept its own `headDoc` snapshot
 * and wrote into that when the room had no add path: a snapshot taken at mount
 * and refreshed only by this view's own installs, so a tray Add made after any
 * edit in the room reinstalled the pre-edit document and reverted it. There is
 * one document; the room owns it, and there is no second way in.
 *
 * The tray is mounted only when the editor mounted (see below), so the absent
 * case is a degraded studio rather than a state a person can press their way
 * into - it still says so instead of going quiet, because a press that reports
 * nothing added reads exactly like a dead button.
