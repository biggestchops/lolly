 * 3D scene boxes inside an export (plan 265 milestone 3, lane C, decision Q19).
 *
 * A Design document can hold any number of `kind: '3d'` boxes, and a browser lends about
 * sixteen WebGL contexts in total, so an export can never be "photograph whatever the live
 * renderers happen to show". Every scene in every export is drawn through the studio pool
 * instead, at the size the output actually needs, and the result is what the export reads:
 *
 *   a STILL (png, svg, pdf, and the rest)   `prepareDesignScenePosters` swaps an
 *       export-quality picture into each marker before the stage shot, so the DOM walker
 *       reads an `<img>` at the box's own pixel size rather than a screen-sized poster or
 *       a live canvas that happens to be mid-frame.
 *   a MOTION format through the compositor  `designSceneFrame` answers the worker's
 *       per-frame `need-live` request with one ImageBitmap of that scene at that moment.
 *
 * Both go through lib/design-scene-mount.ts, which holds the decoded values for each box
 * and serialises the pool. That module and everything under lib/studio3d/ are reached with
 * an `await import()` gated on a marker being present, so a tool with no scene box loads
 * no three.js (shells/web/src/studio3d-boot-guard.test.ts pins it).

 *
 * The five motion formats plus the animated SVG carry a timeline of their own: the

 * preparing a frozen poster first would be a wasted render of the moment nobody sees.
 *
 * The data formats carry no picture at all (the engine has already hydrated their payload),
 * so a scene render for them would cost a GPU frame to produce nothing. Everything else -
 * every raster, every vector, the document and archive writers - photographs the DOM and
