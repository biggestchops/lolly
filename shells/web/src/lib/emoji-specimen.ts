/**
 * Draw a few glyphs of an emoji SET, for chrome that shows the set rather than a
 * document (plans/252, plan 253 section 7).
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, AND THE FIRST IS THE POINT. A pack bundle is 15 to 20 MB, which is
 * far too much to spend on a tile showing five glyphs, so the five are prepared at
 * build time by scripts/emoji-pack-specimens.ts and travel in the catalog entry
 * (`meta.emoji.specimen`). An entry that carries one draws with NO host call and no
 * download at all; the bundle then loads only when a document actually uses the set.
 * An entry with no specimen falls back to the old path - read the exact manifest
 * bytes through `host.emoji`, admit them with the engine's own reader, run the
 * engine's DOM pass over a detached element - so a pack registered before the bake,
 * or one a shell holds and the index does not describe, still draws.
 *
 * Either way there is no second renderer: baked markup came out of the same static
 * SVG subset the live pass uses, `shared.ts` only trusts it while
 * `meta.emoji.specimenOf` still matches the pack's checksum, and a set this device
 * cannot draw shows nothing rather than the machine's own emoji font.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to keep.
 *
 * A tracked pass IS the render (see CLAUDE.md, Emoji), so every pass here is
 * untracked and takes an id scope of its own - placement ids are named after a
 * node's place in the tree it was handed, and two roots walked into one document
 * would otherwise mint the same id and paint each other's gradients. A baked
 * specimen carries the same per-pack prefix, minted by the script.
 *
 * The characters are never written into the live page. A tile paints before any
 * artwork is ready, so a specimen row that held the raw characters in the meantime
 * would be painted by the machine's own emoji font - exactly what choosing a set is
 * for. The fallback path's scratch element is detached; only finished artwork
 * reaches the document.
