 * A composed still that is being PLACED in a document renders at export quality
 * (plan 265 milestone 2, E6, closing Q5(a)).
 *
 * Run with:
 *   node --import ./tests/css-stub.mjs --test tests/compose-export-quality.test.ts
 *
 * A child rendered as a thumbnail takes preview samples and is capped at 800 px, which
 * is right for a card in the asset picker and wrong for the picture a Design image box
 * keeps. The web compose bridge decides from `_stack`: the runtime sets it while
 * resolving an asset inside a parent render, and nothing in the picker does. The
 * quality is part of the cache key, so the same child at both qualities is two entries.
